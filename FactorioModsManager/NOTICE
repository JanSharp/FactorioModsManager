I, Jan Mischak, tried to look for the original copy of the license file for
Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection, but failed to do so. The nuget package
page merely links to the license page at https://licenses.nuget.org/Apache-2.0
And the project page links to the general ASP.NET page at
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet

I must go off of the assumption that there is no additional notice file for
said nuget package.

There was one Notice file i found in a seemlingly generic location for several
nuget packages i would assume, so i am including it just in case, though i do
not believe it is the correct one, if there is one at all.
